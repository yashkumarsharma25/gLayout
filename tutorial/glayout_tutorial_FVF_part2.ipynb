    "## **Target** **Block** : **Flipped Voltage Follwer Cell**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **voltage follower**—also known as a unity-gain buffer or buffer amplifier—is an electronic circuit in which the output voltage precisely follows the input voltage, providing a voltage gain of one. Typically implemented using an operational amplifier (op-amp) with negative feedback, the voltage follower features extremely high input impedance and very low output impedance. This configuration allows it to isolate circuit stages, preventing the loading of the input source and enabling the circuit to drive low-impedance loads without signal degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The voltage follower is fundamental in analog circuit design, ensuring signal fidelity and stability across a wide range of electronic applications. The **Flipped Voltage Follower (FVF)** is an advanced analog circuit topology derived from the conventional source follower, optimized for low-voltage, low-power applications. Unlike the standard voltage follower, the FVF employs a feedback structure that forces the input transistor to operate at a constant drain current, independent of variations in input voltage or load current. This is achieved using shunt negative feedback and ancillary biasing circuitry, resulting in improved linearity and significantly reduced output impedance compared to traditional designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Low Output Impedance:** The FVF provides much lower output impedance than conventional voltage followers, making it highly effective as a voltage buffer in demanding analog applications[9][11].\n",
    "- **High Linearity:** Maintains a consistent voltage transfer characteristic across a wide range of operating conditions[5][9].\n",
    "- **Large Output Current Capability:** Able to source or sink larger currents, supporting class-AB operation and driving heavier loads[4][7][10].\n",
    "- **Low-Voltage Operation:** Well-suited for modern low-supply-voltage and low-power integrated circuit designs[4][5][7][10].\n",
    "- **Applications:** Commonly found in output stages, current mirrors, voltage buffers, gain-boosting circuits, OTAs, filters, and VCOs[4][5][7][10][11].\n",
    "\n",
    "The FVF is a versatile and robust building block in analog and mixed-signal circuit design, offering superior performance for buffering, level shifting, and driving loads in advanced CMOS technologies.\n",
