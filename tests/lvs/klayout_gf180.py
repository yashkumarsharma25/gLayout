"""gf180 LVS via klayout's bundled gf180mcu deck.

magic+netgen on gf180 mis-extracts the substrate (NMOS bulks merge into
VDD via the n-well), so for gf180 we drive the official gf180mcu klayout
LVS deck instead. The deck lives inside the PDK install:

    $PDK_ROOT/ciel/gf180mcu/versions/<HASH>/gf180mcuD/libs.tech/klayout/tech/lvs/run_lvs.py

The version `<HASH>` is recorded in `$PDK_ROOT/ciel/gf180mcu/current`, so
we resolve the deck path through that pointer (no hard-coded version).

This module exposes one entry point, :func:`run_lvs_klayout_gf180`, that
mirrors `pdk.lvs_netgen`'s call signature so the CI harness in
`tests/lvs/run_cell_lvs.py` can dispatch by PDK without restructuring.
